## Description

This is a website created for playing the game pigdice.

## "Plain English" specs

The program picks two numbers at random between one and six when the roll button is pressed simulating the rolling  of two die.

Example:When the user presses roll then the output will be a pair of numbers random numbers between 1 and 6 eg. 3,4 or 2,1 or 6,6 etc.
This output is also visually aided by actual photos of die faces.

When the game begins each player has a total score of zero.For each row the sum of their output is added to their total score.

Example:If a player rolls 2,5 then their new score becomes 7 if they roll again and get 6,2 then their new total score becomes 15 and so on.

But in the case where one of the random numbers is 1 then the scores of that round do not count regardless the score of the other score of the other dice.

Example:If a player had a total score of 10 and rolls 1,6 after his/her round the total score will still be 10

The first player to get to 100 points wins.
